# Exploring Real-Time Scenarios in Laravel with Reverb

With the recent integration of Reverb into the Laravel ecosystem, real-time features have become more accessible without the need for external services. In this project, I aim to explore various scenarios utilizing this capability.

### Scenarios Overview:

- **Live Location Sharing**: Enable real-time sharing of locations between drivers and passengers (client-to-client).
  - You can find the scenario description [here](https://medium.com/devops-dev/live-location-sharing-with-laravel-and-reverb-7c3b8c54bc0d).
